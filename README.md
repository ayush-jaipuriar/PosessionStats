# PosessionStats

My daily productivity score as derived from RescueTime Extention.
This will help me reduce distractions and remain focused.
I will strive to keep 80%+ productivity score on weekdays and 70%+ on weekends for entirety of 2021.
An update will be posted everyday before midnight.

Version 2 added feature: Will also maintain a win streak count which will reset to 0 on the day posession goes below 70%.
Version 3 added feature: Will also maintain a losing streak and a code push streak to 1000 days of code repo.
Version 3.5 added feature: Will also maintain a max win streak and lose streak count.
Version 4 added feature: Maintain an integral streak count with possible negative values instead of using seperate lost streak.
Version 5: Version 4 Removed. Its a gimmick. 
Version 6: Peak Training Streak and Headspace streak, Udemy Streak and LeetCode streak will also be maintained now.
Version 7: All the mentioned streaks have to increment for a day to be considered won, else lost. Also, total days won and lost count will be maintained (Starting March 22,2021)
